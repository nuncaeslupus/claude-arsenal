"""issue_import.py — turn labelled GitHub issues into queue tasks.

The board knows about issues in one direction: a task file gets an issue handle
(`handle_sync.py`). Nothing goes the other way, so an issue filed between
sessions — from a phone, while noticing something, with no session open to seed
a task — is not work as far as the selector is concerned. It never appears in a
batch, never blocks anything, and never shows up on the board. Because an empty
selection is the signal for "report done or ask the user", a repository can be
reported as having no work while carrying a dozen open issues.

That is the same failure the protocol already names for spec divergences — a
record that lives somewhere the queue does not read is a record that stops
existing — one layer further out.

    issue_import.py --issues /tmp/all-issues.json          # what would be imported
    issue_import.py --issues /tmp/all-issues.json --apply  # write the task files

Five things this deliberately does NOT do:

* **It does not import every issue.** Only issues carrying the import label
  (default `arsenal:queue`). Discussion threads and questions are not work, and
  turning them into claimable tasks means a worker opens a PR against a
  question. Opting in is the conservative direction.
* **It does not make the new task claimable.** A seeded task's gate is the issue
  body, which is prose — and a gate that runs nothing passes everything. So the
  task carries `requires: [human:gate]`, a capability no surface offers, which
  makes the selector skip it until a human writes a real gate and removes the
  line. Visible on the board, not dispatchable.
* **It does not open a second issue.** The imported issue *becomes* the handle:
  the caller adds the printed `arsenal-task: <id>` marker to that issue. Opening
  a fresh one would leave two issues for one task and a board that disagrees
  with itself.
* **It does not mint a second task for an issue it has already imported.** The
  task id is derived from the issue's own identity, so the dry run names the id
  `--apply` will use, and running `--apply` twice writes nothing the second
  time. Before this the id was random, and a second run — the ordinary reaction
  to a first one whose remote half never got applied — left two task files for
  one issue.
* **It does not touch the network.** Task files are local and written here;
  every remote change is printed for the caller to apply over whatever channel
  the surface has — the `arsenal-task:` marker to append, and the label swap
  that moves the issue onto the board. With no issues to read it does nothing,
  which is how it degrades when GitHub is unreachable.

Exit: 0 (an empty import is an answer), 2 on unreadable input.

    An issue body is written by a person or a tool for GitHub's renderer, which

    repository that may gate on a Markdown linter, and three defaults failed on
    imported files in real use — the host had to hand-fix each one:

    * a heading with text directly under it (blank lines around headings);
    * a body opening at `###` with nothing above it (heading increment) — the
      front-matter title is the document title, so the body's shallowest
      heading becomes `##`, deeper ones keep their relative depth up to the
      six levels Markdown has, and nothing in the body stays `#`;
    * a `__dunder__` word in prose, which reads as underscore-bold (strong
      style) and renders with its underscores gone. Each `_` of a `__` run is
      escaped, so the word shows as written. Intended `__bold__` is escaped
      too: the two cannot be told apart, and literal text loses nothing.

    Deliberately small. Fenced code, indented code and inline code spans are
    never altered, no line is dropped, and a second pass changes nothing — a
    body normalised twice must not drift. Anything else a linter might flag is

"""gate_target.py — decide what a tool call is about to write inside a skill folder.

Reads a PreToolUse payload on stdin, prints the skill-folder path the call would
modify, or nothing when it would not modify one.

Edit / Write / MultiEdit name their target outright. Bash does not: `sed -i`,
`tee`, a heredoc redirect and a Python one-liner all reach a SKILL.md without
ever appearing as a `file_path`, which is how the gate came to be bypassable by
the edit style the harness encourages.

For Bash the command is tokenised and each simple command is asked where it
*writes*, which is not the same as which paths it mentions. `cp SKILL /tmp/bak`
only reads the skill; `cp /tmp/x SKILL` overwrites it. Getting that distinction
wrong is costly in both directions — a gate that misses a write is no gate, and
one that blocks reads gets routed around instead of through.

Known limits: a path built from a shell variable (`cp "$SKILL" …`) is opaque
here, and so is one assembled at runtime; a wrapper that takes an argument of
its own (`timeout 30 python3 -c …`) hides the interpreter behind it; and a
script file — or a module run with `-m` — is trusted to be what it says it is,
since its contents are not read. This raises the cost of an accidental bypass; it is not a sandbox.

# WRITERS is a list of ways to write a file, and that list cannot be finished:

# string built at runtime, and the next spelling nobody has thought of yet all

# code gets tidier — ruff's PTH123 pushes `open(p, "w")`, which WRITERS catches
# on its mode, toward `Path(p).open("w")`, which it cannot, because builtin
# `open` takes the path first and `Path.open` takes the mode first. Every miss
# is fail-open on a gate whose job is to refuse.

# So for an interpreter running source on the command line or on stdin, the
# polarity is inverted: a skill path in that source is a write **unless** every
